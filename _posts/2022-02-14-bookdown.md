Bookdown is an R package that allows writing books (or long articles), easily integrating R code and results, and publishing them online for free. I recently used the package for [this book](https://bookdown.org/andreabellavia/mixtures/).

To begin with using bookdown it is essential to be acquainted with R markdown:
- [R markdown: The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)

A comprehensive guide is available online:
- [bookdown: Authoring Books and Technical Documents with R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/)

To begin it is recommended to clone [this github repository](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown-demo) and to check the official documentation on the [main website](https://bookdown.org/). The main website also contains information on how to easily publish the final version (or a working one) online.
