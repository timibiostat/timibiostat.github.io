Evaluating the amount of missingness is one of the first checks required in pre-analytical phases. As usual, there are tons of available resources to evaluate missingness in R. A very simple yet effective option is to use the package `naniar` that allows a direct assessment of missingness in 2 lines:

{% highlight r %}
library(naniar)
gg_miss_var(data)
{% endhighlight %}

Comprehensive and user-friendly reviews of this and other packages' functionality can be found [here](http://juliejosse.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/DataAnalysisMissingR.html) and [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/naniar/vignettes/getting-started-w-naniar.html)
