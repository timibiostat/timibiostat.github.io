- [Pseudo R-squared](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survival/vignettes/discrim.pdf): different measures that can be calculated in R with the [`royston` function](https://rdrr.io/cran/survival/man/royston.html)

How do we compare 2 models?

- Harrell points out that testing the difference of 2 C-indices is a low-power procedure and that a LRT comparison would be better ([link](https://www.fharrell.com/post/addvalue/))
- [This paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5909734/) clarifies the theoretical reasons against providing a p-value that compares two C-indices
