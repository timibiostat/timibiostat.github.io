This is one of the most challenging and stimulating books I have read in a while. 

Here some useful resources for someone approaching the topic from a biostat background point of view:

- [Notes from Andrew Gelman ](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2007/04/09/nassim_talebs_t/)
- [Mini lectures in probability from the Author](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMV8UXQuOWKPAIjvnyMN2317LHF3ydvnG)
